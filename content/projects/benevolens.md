## Python Discord Code Jam 2023

I participated in the Python Discord Code Jam, an annual event that provides an opportunity for individuals to collaborate on coding projects. A Code Jam is essentially a competition where participants are grouped into teams and given a specific programming task and theme to guide their project. They have a limited time frame, usually a little over a week, to create the best possible project based on the given theme and requirements.

In the context of the Python Discord Code Jam, this event focuses on fostering creativity, teamwork, and coding skills. It's a chance for developers to work together to create innovative and exciting projects, often with a specific focus or theme, as was the case with this year's theme of "Secret Codes" and the use of image manipulation tools. Code Jams are not only about competition but also a great opportunity for learning, collaboration, and having fun with coding.

To participate in the Python Discord Code Jam, I had to complete a qualifier task. This task involved rearranging tiles in an image based on specific rules. The goal was to ensure that the provided input allowed for a valid rearrangement. I had to implement functions to check if the tile size divided the image size without remainders and if the provided ordering used each input tile exactly once. This qualifier task tested my skills in image manipulation and validation logic and was a prerequisite for participating in the Code Jam event.

## Our Project

Benevolens is an automatic secret code translation tool! Its main functionality consists of passing an image with a secret code somewhere on it, then Benevolens will create a new image that contains the decoded text.

The program uses Tesseract to read text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Using steganography and text ciphers, Benevolens inputs physical images of handwritten text, and can decode it according to some cipher. This text is generated by the tool itself.

Benevolens does have a Command-Line Interface (CLI) which makes the tool quick and easy to use and set up. Hidden messages can be stored by hand in handwritten notes, and quickly deciphered using the tool.

## Optical Character Recognition

Benevolens inputs an image that contains some encoded (handwritten) text and outputs an image with that section translated.

Using a random (or generated) noise cipher image, or a seed, text is read from an image and parsed using that cipher.

## Steganography (second feature)

Image steganography is a technique of hiding secret information or data within an image without altering its visible appearance to the human eye. In other words, it's a way to embed hidden messages or content within an image so that it appears like a normal image to casual observers. This can be achieved by subtly modifying the image's pixel values or other data while preserving the image's overall visual integrity. Image steganography is often used for secure communication and data concealment.

Using XOR images for steganography involves taking two original images, performing a bitwise XOR operation between them to create a third image. This third image serves as a hidden container. What's intriguing is that you can XOR one of the original images with this container to reveal the other original image. XOR's reversible property makes this possible; XORing the same values twice cancels out the effect, offering a simple yet reversible way to hide and retrieve one image within another. However, it's important to note that this method is not a robust encryption technique and is mainly used for educational or basic data concealment purposes.
