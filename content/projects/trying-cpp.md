# C++ shitpost vid

## The Video

Granted access to Premiere Pro, I tried actually editing for once.

I am not particularly interested in editing videos, but here's my attempt.

So enjoy this random shitpost + brainrot programming meme video.

<div class="iframe-container landscape">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POhGwp-ZNHM?si=2BUAeS-YCah4EM7d" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## What's the Point?

This is basically my test run of "could i be a youtuber?"

I learned editing sucks, takes too much time, and I'd rather keep a blog updated lol.

Heavily edited "Mr. Beast style" videos are too much for me ngl.

But in all honesty, it's pretty funny and people actually seemed to like it.
