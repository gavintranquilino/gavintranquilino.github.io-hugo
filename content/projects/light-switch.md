## Overview

3D printed, servo actuated, Raspberry Pi webserver, Discord API integration.

I wanted to create a device that can manually click the rocker switch of my room light on and off. I did not want to have to mess with any of the electrical circuits of the light switch system underneath the cover.

## 3D Printed Bracket

The bracket I designed for the servo motor was modelled in Fusion360.

After learning the basics of CAD software, I was comfortable modelling the bracket on my own with precise measurements. Alongside the 3D printer, I used digital calipers for accurate prototyping.

Below is the finished bracket mount. I contemplated white vs. black filament, settling on black for contrast (Panda-themed).

Messing with 3D printer settings, I plan to enable ironing for smoother prints. I also intend to add modular connectors so sensors and mounts can be swapped like Legos.
