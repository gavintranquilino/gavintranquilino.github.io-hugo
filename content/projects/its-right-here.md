## What is this?

Lame Norwegian friend was searching for a keychain for my "friend" poopwrld.

He was streaming his screen to the groupchat (Discord ðŸ¤¢), and we found the funniest item on sale.

It was some random Norwegian site for gag items??

I thought it was such a random red arrow meme idea that I **NEEDED** to recreate it.

## 3D Printing

I have a Kingroon KP3S, and I have really liked its performance.

It has failed with the hotend at some points, but honestly it is such a reliable 3D printer.

I really like its size since it can fit on my shelves.

I got it sliced on Cura and sent it off to print!

I added a brim to hold the rounded edges at the bottom and tree supports to hold up that narrow part of the arrow.

## Painting

I used some of my sister's acrylic paint to fully paint it red.

I don't actually own any red filament, so painting it matte was my only option.

Honestly, it turned out really well and resembled exactly how it was in the pictures from the Norwegian site.

## Final Product

It turned out really well and I was really happy with the final product.

It was a really fun project to work on and I'm glad I was able to recreate it.

It was a really random idea, but I'm glad I was able to bring it to life.

## Conclusion

3D printing is mega awesome and great for making this stuff.

I am also a god at 3D modelling.
