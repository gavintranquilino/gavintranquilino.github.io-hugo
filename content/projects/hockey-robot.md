## Skills Ontario Robotics Competition 2023

The Skills Ontario Competition is a prestigious event held annually in Ontario, Canada, that provides a platform for top students to showcase their skills and expertise in various vocational and technical fields. This competition spans over two and a half days and attracts participants, educators, families, and potential employers. Participants aim to prove that they are the best in their respective fields, competing in a wide range of skill-based contests.

## Making the robot

I played a pivotal role in the Skills Ontario Robotics Competition. While it was rooted in VEX robotics, our team took an unconventional approach.

## Building from the Ground Up

Rather than relying on VEX robotics kits, we decided to construct every component from scratch. We used 3-phase motors, drill batteries, and even fabricated our aluminum chassis for the robot. Managing the robot's electronics was a major task. It operated wirelessly and could connect to Bluetooth PS2 controllers. Arduino boards powered it, and every piece had to be soldered meticulously.

We undertook the intricate task of understanding each electronic component and how they intricately interacted. Our responsibilities extended to coding each module from the ground up. But it didn't stop there. We took on the monumental challenge of drawing the circuit diagram entirely by hand. This comprehensive hands-on approach was the most immersive engineering experience we could have ever hoped for.

## Electronics Components

### Bluetooth Module and Motor Drivers

Our setup used a Bluetooth PS2 controller interface, custom Arduino code, and three-phase motor drivers. We integrated:

## Facing Challenges and Time Constraints

Given that our entire team was in grade 12, busy with college and university applications, we had limited time for the project. We dedicated an hour or two after school, once or twice a week. However, as the deadline loomed closer, we had to be excused from classes for an entire day to make progress. Integrating various components into a functional robot was one of our most significant challenges.

## Overnight Hotel Room Overhaul

Upon arriving in Toronto for the competition, the robot malfunctioned due to our custom H-bridge drivers. We spent an entire night in a hotel room, soldering, hot gluing, and debugging. What was intended as a quick fix turned into a 36-hour marathon of troubleshooting.

## Competition and Lessons Learned

Despite using non-standard components and hastily assembling the robot, we challenged bots built from VEX kits. Although we didn't secure first place, we got our 3-phase motor drivers working and finished respectably.

## My Contribution

I led the mechanical, electrical, and software integration: designing robust circuits, integrating three-phase motors, and writing the control code under tight deadlines.

## Exploring Toronto and Unplanned Adventures

On the last day, instead of final matches, our team explored Toronto: CN Tower, boba tea, Vietnamese cuisine, and Jackbox games. Back in the hotel, we pranked a sleeping teammate by stacking pillows, chairs, and pots, creating a hilarious spectacle.

## Custom Patches

We designed custom patches featuring our robot, an orange game ball, a 15-tooth gear for May 1st (competition day), a crown symbolizing our unique approach, and blue and white for our school colors. The motto "No Kit Needed" represents our philosophy of building from scratch.
