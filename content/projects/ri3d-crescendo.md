## The Final Build!

Check out what we made! Really proud of this robot given the time constraints and lack of members.

## My Contributions

I worked on the drivetrain and gearbox assembly, setting up and flashing the electronics, and 3D printing custom components.

Overall, I had a lot of fun over these 3 days and honestly learned a lot along the way.

It was very hackathon-ish, so I found lots of joy in that.
