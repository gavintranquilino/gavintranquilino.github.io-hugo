## Cravin' Vinyls?

Like many other great businesses, Cravin' Vinyls once started as an idea, a motive, a thought. I remember hearing about a small business grant for at least $1000 during COVID and wondered, "I should totally give this a shot!" Unfortunately, all my previous ideas for products and services quickly came to an abrupt stop. Soon after the grant had ended, I remembered my mom's old cutting machine (which had been refurbished) and knew that I could make things with it. From one personal project to the next, I quickly learned how to use this thing. From that moment on, Cravin' Vinyls has been my very first attempt at a small business/side hustle.

## Exploration Phase

I embarked on this journey by tinkering with a cutting machine designed for cake decorating, known as Baker's Craft. My initial experiments involved cutting out paper pictures of friends. The discovery that I could project their shadows onto my walls using a simple lamp opened up a world of possibilities.

## Evolution of Ideas

My initial experimentation with paper soon transitioned into using stickers, which I applied to night lights. While I tried various night light designs, I eventually settled on a clear acrylic square that worked perfectly with vinyl stickers.

## Growing the Business

I initiated my venture by sharing my designs with friends and family, gradually expanding my customer base. As interest grew, I decided to set up an Etsy store. Positive reviews and increased recognition from customers across Canada motivated me to deal with logistics, handle a growing number of orders, and offer customization.

## Venturing into Clothing Design

My exploration didn't stop at night lights and stickers. I delved into clothing design, experimenting with dropshipping through itemshop.club. Initially, I considered rebranding and tried various platforms, but the expected growth didn't materialize. Instead of rebranding, I merged ItemShop's clothing offerings into Cravin' Vinyls. Today, I provide a range of shirts featuring anime, memes, pop culture references, and more.

## Establishing Passive Income

I've streamlined my operations, enabling customers to easily order shirts from my Etsy page. Automation allows them to choose from designs I've already created. While I continue to craft vinyl sticker lights to order, it's truly rewarding to receive feedback and reviews from satisfied customers.
