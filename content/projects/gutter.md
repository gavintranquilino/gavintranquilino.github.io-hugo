## What's this for?

The roof rain gutter of my house dumps water straight onto the lawn.

This ruins the lawn right where the water is dumped.

We have a downspout tube to attach to the spout, but there is no good connection to the spout as there are two connected in parallel.

We could simply buy an adaptor to fit around 2 spouts, but I took the initiative to 3D print my own.

## Designing

As seen below, there just needs to be some plastic material that would funnel the output from the spouts to the downspout tubing.

I measured the openings using calipers, and used Fusion360 to model my design.

I went for a solid shell-like funnel for simple geometry and easy to print.

At this size, this is the largest print that I have ever attempted.

It has failed once, but I unfortunately did not capture that moment.

## Results

It was effective at redirecting the rain from our lawn, and it improved the overall drainage at the back of the house.

I'd say it was a nice success.

For a couple cents and multiple hours, I brought my idea to life.
