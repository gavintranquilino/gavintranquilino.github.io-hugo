## Overview

A simple LED lamp. Automated.

## How Did I Do It?

FYI: If you don't already know, you can click the images to be redirected to either code or a video.

I am very proud of this project, mostly because I find it to be the most useful, despite its simplicity.

I rewired the lamp to a separate transistor switch circuit. From there, it connects one of my Raspberry Pis to a Discord Bot.

This was done on purpose in order to not have to port forward, and also so that my friends and I could turn the lamp on and off whenever we please.

## Conclusion

The lamp bot was initially assembled on a small breadboard, then upgraded to its own perfboard. It may be further improved in the future. Curious to see where this goes next!
