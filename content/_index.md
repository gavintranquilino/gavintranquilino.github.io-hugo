As a mechatronics engineering student from the University of Waterloo, I work on 3D mechanical design, embedded programs, IoT, robots, and all things nerd. I like to keep this portfolio updated with various projects I work on.

Honestly, I'm just a guy who likes to tinker with things and see how they work. These skills and experiences are just a side effect of my curiosity. When someone asks for my hobbies, I usually say that I like to build things.

Also, I have a YouTube channel where I post videos about projects and things I have tinkered with that are not on this site. It contains snippets of small projects that just aren't worth making dedicated pages for. Go check it out below!

<em>Quick Note:</em> My YouTube channel and Resumé are honestly probably more up to date than this site depending on when you're viewing this.
